# Technical debt

Things found along the way that are deliberately deferred rather than
fixed on the spot, so they don't get lost. Reviewed and addressed as
part of **MVP-011 — Tests and hardening** (see `PROJECT.md`), unless
picked up sooner.

Each entry: what it is, where it came from, and what fixing it would
involve.

## Disk cleanup for job files

**Found in:** MVP-004.5 review

Nothing removes old jobs' downloaded audio, separated stems, or
transcription output under `backend/data/jobs/`. Disk usage grows
unbounded as jobs accumulate.

**Fix would involve:** a retention policy (age-based or count-based)
and a cleanup task (scheduled or triggered on new job creation).

## No concurrency limit on heavy pipeline jobs

**Found in:** MVP-004.5 review

Each job spawns its own Demucs subprocess (and, from MVP-005 on, its
own DrumScript subprocess) with no cap on how many can run at once.
Several simultaneous submissions could exhaust CPU/RAM.

**Fix would involve:** a job queue or semaphore limiting how many
pipeline runs execute concurrently, with the rest waiting in `queued`.

## No retry for failed pipeline steps

**Found in:** MVP-004.5 review (not previously in PROJECT.md's plan)

A job that fails has no way to be re-run — the user has to submit the
same URL again as a brand-new job.

**Fix would involve:** a `POST /api/jobs/{id}/retry`-style endpoint (or
similar) that re-runs the pipeline from the failed step using the
job's existing state, rather than starting over from scratch.

## Tempo estimation disagrees with DrumScript's own estimate

**Found in:** MVP-006 manual verification

Our independent `LibrosaTempoEstimator` (used for beat/measure
mapping) produced ~123 BPM on a test track, while DrumScript's own
internal tempo estimate (visible in its transcription logs, not
currently consumed by us) was ~184.6 BPM on similar material. `123 ×
1.5 ≈ 184.6` — a classic pulse-level ambiguity (simple vs. compound
meter interpretation of the same rhythm), not a bug in either
estimator, but it means the two tempo values used across the pipeline
can disagree.

**Fix would involve:** picking one tempo source consistently (or
cross-validating both and preferring the one with higher confidence),
and/or adding octave-error correction (e.g. checking whether
half/double the detected tempo fits the onset grid better) to
`LibrosaTempoEstimator`.
